\section{Rationale and Research
Questions}\label{rationale-and-research-questions}}

The purpose of this study was to synthesize and analyze the findings of
local water quality samples measuring a group of emerging contaminants,
PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances). The two datasets from DEQ
(2018 Emerging Compounds Monitoring Reports of various watersheds and
public water supply (PWS) reservoirs and the 2019 wastewater treatment
plant (WWTP) samples) were chosen as the only publicly-available
datasets on local PFAS levels. The sample locations and variables were
pre-determined by the study, but these datasets reflect locations and
variables pertaining to the levels of various PFAS analytes in the
drinking water and water bodies associated with 2.7 million North
Carolina residents.

Our study aims to explore and analyze this data in order to begin
building the larger story of local contamination and identify areas of
concern that need further investigation. To do so, we answered the
following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Occurence
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What are the most abundant analytes present?
\item
  Which sites have analytes exceeding health advisory levels?
\item
  What chain lengths are most abundant and present?
\item
  What portion of total PFAS are PFOA and PFOS?
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  Distribution
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Are there bodies of water with concerningly high levels of PFAS that
  aren't commonly discussed?
\item
  How does total PFAS change over time?
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  Unreported / Further Investigation
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What is the highest reporting limit for each analyte?
\item
  How many samples had reporting limits above health advisory levels?
\item
  What percentage of total unreported results were below health advisory
  limits?
\end{itemize}

\section{Dataset Information}\label{dataset-information}}

The two datasets were downloaded from North Carolina DEQ:
\href{https://deq.nc.gov/about/divisions/water-resources/water-resources-science-and-data/water-sciences-home-page/emerging}{2018
Analytical Results for PFAS Screening of Select Public Water Supply
(PWS) Reservoirs} and
\href{https://files.nc.gov/ncdeq/Water\%20Resources/GIS/Data/Emerging_Compounds_Mastersheet_12202019.pdf}{2019
publicaly owned utilities with pretreatment programs (POTWs) and
industrial dischargers with state permits}. Respective to their type of
site, both datasets contained site location, sample date, PFAS analyte
levels (nanograms per liter (ng/L) or equivalent parts per trillion
(ppt)), and lab qualifiers/reporting limits. To substantiate this
analysis, we incorporated a manually created csv file identifying the
latitude and longitude of sample sites, and researched analytes' chain
length (short or long).

Due to the nature of their original format, both datasets needed
extensive cleaning prior to importing to R and further exploration and
analysis. The POTW data was originally in a PDF and first needed to be
converted (using SmallPDF tool) to an excel spreadsheet. These values
were then manually moved intoa dataset layout (column headings, rows for
each analyte sampled). The PWS dataset was already a csv dataset. For
both, analytes with dashes (-) needed to be replaced with a different
character (.) in order to read into R and column names were changed to
be consistent with other. The lab qualifiers were split so that there
was a unique column of numeric reporting limits and in PWS the
``results'' value was deleted because it was actually the reporting
limit and not a result, despite being originally in that column
(indicated with corresponding lab qualifier characters).

Once these three datasets were imported into R Studio, both POTW and PWS
needed the ``sample date'' column formatted as a date class and
unnecessary columns were removed. To pivot each wider for future use,
their reporting limit column was removed and then each pivoted wider so
that each analyte became a column with its corresponding parts per
trillion measurement. We then mutated both datasets to create columns
for Total PFAS, the sum of PFOA and PFOS (due to health advisory
regulation), the sum of all short-chained PFAS, and the sum of all
long-chained PFAS.

To create a column for chain length in the original long datasets, we
used a function to determine if each analyte was short or long, adding
the result in the column. Then, both were joined to the imported
location dataset so each site had a longitude and latitude. These
cleaned files were then saved in the
Data\textgreater\textgreater Processed folder as csv.

indicates that there are sites that may have high levels of PFAS that
are overlooked. While there is no specific value that is ``too'' high,
long-chain PFAS are a known health risk at lower levels (e.g., 8ppt).

\hypertarget{what-are-the-most-abundant-analytes-present}{%
\subsubsection{What are the most abundant analytes
present?}\label{what-are-the-most-abundant-analytes-present}}

The following two plots indicate the analytes present in POTW and PWS
samples. First, the finding indicates that a wider variety of analytes
were found in POTW compared to PWS, which may indicate additional or
different contamination sources. It may also be an indicator of varioius
PFAS precursors and or their degraded forms, which further research can
focus on identifying patterns influencing those changes. Lastly, these
graphs are the first clue that PFOA, PFOS, and GenX (the most commonly
discussed, researched, and regulated analytes) may not be the most
abundant PFAS we are exposed to via water.

\hypertarget{which-sites-have-analytes-exceeding-health-advisory-levels}{%
\subsubsection{Which sites have analytes exceeding health advisory
levels?}\label{which-sites-have-analytes-exceeding-health-advisory-levels}}

Using the unique function allows a closer look at the number of sites
with analytes above 30ppt and 70ppt (common health advisory or
regulatory limits for PFOA and PFOS). In the POTW samples, there were 23
sites with analytes above 30ppt and 13 above 70ppt. In PWS samples, 11
sites were above 30ppt and 5 above 70ppt. Rather than comparing the two,
these numbers indicate that a signficant number of sites had analytes at
what could potentially be a concerning level, and further research is
needed to determine if those specific analytes exceeding 30ppt and 70ppt
pose a health risk. Certainly, they indicate the widespread presence of
high levels of PFAS in North Carolina.

The following plots elaborate on this data, indicating which sites
showed those respective levels. This information can be used to target
subsequent sampling, depending on if the particular analytes pose a
health risk to the communities nearby.

\subsubsection{What chain lengths are most abundant and
present?}\label{what-chain-lengths-are-most-abundant-and-present}}

PFAS have characteristically strong carbon bonds, and depending on their
chain length, are categorized as either short- or long-chained PFAS.
Long-chain PFAS are most researched (e.g., PFOA, PFOS) and take a long
time to degrade. Furthermore, certain remediation treatments (such as
the common and most affordable granular activated carbon (GAC)) are only
effective at removing long-chain PFAS.

The following graphs indicate the proportion of total PFAS by chain
length. This information should inform remediation and treatment
upgrades as well as be interpolated to identify risks (for example,
sites with predominantly short-chained PFAS but with GAC treatment may
falsely assume it is adequately treating the risk to its community).

This graph of POTW sites further illustrate the concern that the public
is over-focused on PFOA and PFOS and is overlooking potential dangers
from high total PFAS. Specifically, sites such as Sanford-Big Buffalo
Creek get a lot of public attention because it had a high level of
PFOA/PFOS but sites like the Town of Ramsur, Rose Hill, and Wallace
Regional WWTPs had total PFAS above 250ppt and are infrequently
mentioned.

Expanding upon Question 1, graphing the top 12 highest total PFAS sites
is the first step for researchers and regulators to focus further
investigatory sampling. As mentioned before, in addition to the commonly
publicized Burlington and Sandford-Big Buffalo Creek WWTPs, the Town of
Ramseur, City of Mebane, Wallace Regional City of Raeford, Greensboro,
Wilmington (North and Southside), North Harnett Regional, and City of
Durham/South Durham Water Reclamation sites have surprisingly high total
PFAS.

Only the POTW dataset provided enough data for a temporal analysis, but
it is ill-advised to make broad conclusions based on a three-month
testing period. The first graph seems to indicate that, although there
are isolated spikes, total PFAS remained consistently high and possibly
increasing. A closer look (second graph removing outlier) illustrates
that there was a definitive spike across multiple sites in August.
Further research and more extensive sampling is needed to identify
whether this is a temporal/seasonal trend, or if there were
source-specific variables that impacted these levels.

\subsubsection{How many samples had reporting limits above health

As demonstrated earlier in the exploratory section, both datasets
indicated reporting levels and lab qualifiers with relevant results.
Concerningly, many samples had high reporting limits meaning that many
samples did not have a reported value.

Using 30ppt as a benchmark for what a potentially conceringly high
reporting level is, the following histogram illustrates the number of
samples that had reporting limits above 30ppt. From these results, it
can be inferred that a signficant number of samples had unreported
analytes above 30ppt, meaning there are potentially many sites with
concerning levels of PFAS analytes that are being overlooked and
possibly mis-identified as `safe'. Note that PWS had an overwhelmingly
large number of unreported analyte samples due to these reporting
limits.

\subsubsection{What percentage of total unreported results were above

Looking closer at the previous results, the following percentages clue
researchers and regulators into how concerning these reporting limits
are. While only 8.74\% of analytes in the POTW samples were unreported
at levels over 30ppt, a notably large 96.97\% of the analytes sampled at
PWS sites were unreported above 30ppt. This indicates an urgent need to
reconsider and likely re-sample these sites for safety reasons. Further
analysis should also consider the reporting limits as they pertain to
specific analytes or chain-lengths, depending on health risks and
upcoming regulation.

What conclusions do you draw from your findings? Relate your findings
back to the original research questions and rationale.

The original purpose of this research was to synthesis the current
publicly-available datasets on PFAS levels in North Carolina, begin
building a bigger picture of the emerging contaminant PFAS presence, and
identify areas of concern. The most notable findings from the cleaning
process, exploration, and analysis are as follows: 1. The current data
management structure for emerging contaminants in the state of North
Carolina makes it prohibitively difficult for researchers and
policymakers to grasp a comprehensive picture of PFAS occurance,
distribution, and risk. Specifically, the static PDF report of POTW
sample results, inconsistent names and formats for analytes, and
confusing presentation of reporting limits (e.g., PWS dataset displaying
limits in the same column as results) is a signifcant barrier to
subsequent synthesis and analysis.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item
  Despite signficant public and regulatory attention on the long-chain
  PFOA and PFOS analytes, this research clearly demonstrates that these
  are a small percentage of total PFAS present in North Carolina water.
  A narrow focus on these compounds causes an overlook of other water
  bodies that may pose significant health risks. Furthermore, it is
  clear that short-chain PFAS are the most abundant in these samples
  which should direct further research into associated health risks and
  inform remediation options because most treatment methods are
  ineffective at removing short-chain PFAS.
\item
  There is insufficient publicly-available data at this time to
  understand temporal and spatial trends, however the three-month
  sampling period for POTWs illustrated coinciding spikes and possibly
  an increasing trend over the summer months which needs further
  investigation.
\item
  The staggeringly high reporting limits (particularly for PWS samples)
  are a clear indication that any conclusions about risk, total PFAS, or
  appropriate remediation based on these datasets are likely
  misinformed. There is an urgent need for these sites to be re-tested
  in a manner that allows the lab to confidently report analyte levels
  at or above limits appropriate to their health risk (e.g, 10 ppt for
  long-chain PFAS).
